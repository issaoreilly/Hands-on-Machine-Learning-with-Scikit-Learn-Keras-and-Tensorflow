# Hands-on-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow

This repository contains comprehensive notes and lesson summaries for each chapter of the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow." In addition to the original content, I have supplemented the material with further explanations and clarifications on various topics using GPT4. GPT-4 has played a crucial role in assisting with the development of these enhanced notes.

For the best usage of this repository, you can visit each chapter's notes directly in its associated Jupyter Notebook.
